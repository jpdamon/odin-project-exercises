    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>"Jeera Aloo is a typical vegetarian Indian dish which is often served
         as a side dish and normally goes well with hot puris, chapatti,
        roti or dal. Its main ingredients are potatoes (aloo), 
        cumin seeds (jeera) and Indian spices. Other ingredients 
        are red chili powder, ginger, coriander powder, curry leaves, 
        vegetable oil and salt. In its traditional form the dish is 
        not hot, but it could be spiced up by adding powdered cayenne 
        pepper. Other variations of the dish make use of sweet potatoes 
        instead of regular ones."</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeera_aloo">-Wikipedia</a>
